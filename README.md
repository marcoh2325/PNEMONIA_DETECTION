# PNEMONIA_DETECTION

Members: Jes√∫s Moncho, Helen Navarro,Ruben Tenreiro and Marco Hernani

This project was made during the master in Data Science from Assembler Institute of Technology <br>
The main goal was to create a model that detects pneumonia cases from X-rays images <br>
<p>
This images where divided into two folders one with the images for the test set and other with images for the train set. Inside each one of
those folders there were two folders one with the X-ray images for the lungs with pneumonia and other for the non-pneumonia cases.

Pneumonia_detection.ipynb contains the code to create the model and the process to get the test set and the train set so it can be used by the model.
Pneumonia_detection.pdf contains a presentation made for this project.
